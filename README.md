# C Data Structures

A collection of classic data structures implemented in **C**, with a unified API, modular design, and automated tests.

This project demonstrates low-level programming skills, memory management, and algorithmic thinking through clean implementations and verification of core data structures.

## 📦 Implemented Data Structures

| Structure     | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| Stack        | Linked-list based stack with push/pop operations |
| Queue        | Linked-list based queue with enqueue/dequeue |
| Heap         | Max-Heap with insert, delete-max, sift-up/down |
| Binary Tree  | Binary Search Tree (BST) with traversal and search |
| AVL Tree     | Self-balancing AVL tree with rotations |
| Hash Table   | Hash table with chaining, insert/search/delete |
| Graph        | Graph with BFS, DFS and shortest path (BFS) |

## 🧠 Key Features

- Modular design with clear separation between interface and implementation (`.h` / `.c`)
- Clean and consistent public APIs for each data structure
- Manual memory management using `malloc` and `free`
- Use of both iterative and recursive algorithms
- Graph traversal using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Unified test suite validating all data structures from `main.c`
